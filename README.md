# React Native Meteor Accounts

The code associated with my React Native Meteor Accounts tutorials.

_This is a work in progress. I will be emailing updates to this [email list](http://eepurl.com/bXLcvT) otherwise just check back here._

# Facebook OAuth
Please follow [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@spencer_carli/react-native-meteor-oauth-with-facebook-3d1346d7cdb7#.kr5f8jorz).

You'll need to create a settings.json file (see MeteorApp/settings.example.js for an example) and add your keys.
You can then run the app via `meteor --settings settings.json`.

You'll have to do the necessary config for React Native (see tutorial) then you can run via the following commands. These should be run from the `RNFacebookExample` directory.

- _iOS_: `npm run ios`
- _Android_: `react-native run-around`

# Email + Password

Please follow [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@spencer_carli/react-native-meteor-auth-with-email-username-and-password-d2085c732276#.9hoskbvnr).

After starting the meteor server run either of the commands in the `RNPasswordExample` directory.
- _iOS_: `npm run ios`
- _Android_: `react-native run-around`
